# Bizmates Technical Exam

I designed a simple yet functional UI/UX so the traveller can see only the important things and use minimal taps/clicks.

I did my best just to finish the technical exam on time as I've been sick with the flu for 3 days now and I've just been lying in bed. And I nearly gave up but I really want to have a better paying job so I made it my goal to just accomplish the given objectives before the deadline.

I was not able to use venue api as I cannot get a key anymore because it is now replaced with places api.
