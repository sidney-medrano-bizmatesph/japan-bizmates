                        There is always something exciting about going to
                        school. After all, we are nurtured in a culture where
                        education is regarded not just as a way of life, but a
                        commodity that could one day be our single most
                        important asset. From my experience, our educational
                        upbringing has always wanted us to perform beyond
                        expectations.

                        While our end goals may all be the same, the roads we
                        take are different. Some may want to take the more
                        arduous journey to reach their big dreams, while many
                        simply want to get to the finish line. Both are valid --
                        to each his own.

                        With the explosion of information, the excitement of
                        going to school everyday is slowly being replaced by
                        daily struggles, frustrations, and hopelessness. There
                        is too much of everything in so little time. It is from
                        this context that we developed the PLE-REAP App, a
                        software application combining evidence-based learning
                        strategies from the most reliable people.

                        Learning need not be hard. Waking up every weekday
                        morning need not be a struggle, too. The saying, “Go
                        through bigger struggles to get the best out of life,”
                        is certainly not true. Neither do we need to have the
                        highest IQs to be successful. We simply have to be
                        smart. Getting the right tools, learning from the right
                        people, and being constantly inspired are the things
                        that will get us through. PLE-REAP is simply power at
                        your fingertips.
